# 🧠 Machine Learning Training Repository

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Training** repository!  
This project is a collection of practical machine learning scripts and notebooks developed to demonstrate the core steps in building, training, and evaluating ML models. A key focus of this repo is predicting real estate prices using regression techniques.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `Dragon Real Estates.ipynb` – End-to-end implementation of a housing price predictor model.
- `Model Usage.ipynb` – Guide to using the saved model (`Dragon.joblib`) for real-world predictions.
- `Outputs from different models/` – Contains results and outputs from different ML algorithms.
- `data.csv` – Dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `Dragon.joblib` – Pre-trained machine learning model saved using joblib.
- `housing.data` & `housing.names` – Additional dataset for experimentation.
- `end-to-end-ml.zip` – Compressed archive of the entire ML pipeline.
